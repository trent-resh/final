# final

Here is my CU Boulder 3022 Final Project. Unfortunately, YouTube apparently does not allow videos over 15 minutes in length - it will
delete the video some time after it was uploaded and processes. Therefore the link in my submission will no longer be accessible.
To access my video you must use this Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=122BaesYKEEoPCrlzGF_hKnd9i2ZnsJ1B

The code for the data collection is in the file cass_test.py, while the jupyter notebook has the data analysis/visualization.
